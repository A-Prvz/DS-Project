# DS-Project
In this Repository, we have presented the codes for the suffix sorting techniques( Both Conventional and the Linear Time Suffix Sorting method).

***********
The suffix array and its variants are text-indexing data structures that have become indispensable in the field of bioinformatics. With the uninitiated in mind, we provide an accessible exposition of the SA-IS algorithm, which is the state of the art in suffix array construction.

The algorithm for Linear Time Suffix Sorting introduces a new sorting principle that can be used to build the first non-recursive linear-time suffix array construction algorithm.
